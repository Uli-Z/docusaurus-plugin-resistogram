goals:
  - "Introduce localization (i18n) for the ResistanceTable component."
  - "Allow users to set the display language via a `locale` prop in the `%%Resist` directive."
  - "Translate all UI labels of the component into German, English, French, Spanish, and Italian."
  - "Load and display organism and antibiotic names from the data sources in the selected language."
  - "Ensure the component defaults to the current Docusaurus site language if no `locale` is specified."

constraints:
  - "The implementation must be done within the existing React component structure."
  - "The solution should be easily extensible for new languages."
  - "Data column naming convention (e.g., `name_de`, `name_en`) must be handled dynamically."

out_of_scope:
  - "Adding automated E2E tests for localization (will be tested manually by the user)."
  - "Translating the content of the website itself (e.g., Markdown pages)."
  - "Adding new languages beyond DE, EN, FR, ES, IT in this iteration."

acceptance_criteria:
  - "When a user adds `locale=\"de\"` to the `%%Resist` directive, all UI texts and relevant data (organisms, antibiotics, sources) are displayed in German."
  - "When a user adds `locale=\"fr\"`, UI texts are displayed in French. Data names (antibiotics, etc.) fall back to English if a French version (`_fr`) is not available in the data files."
  - "If the `locale` prop is omitted, the component automatically uses the active language from Docusaurus for both UI and data."
  - "The system correctly falls back to English data names if the requested language's data column does not exist."
  - "The implementation does not break any existing functionality of the `ResistanceTable` component."
