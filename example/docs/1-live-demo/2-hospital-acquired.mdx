# Live Demo: `auto` mode for HAP

This page describes a typical case of **Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP)**.

Key bacteria include ***Pseudomonas aeruginosa***, ***Klebsiella pneumoniae***, and ***Staphylococcus aureus***.

According to current guidelines, the calculated initial therapy depends on the patient's risk factors. For patients with an increased risk of multi-resistant pathogens (MRE), a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as **Piperacillin/Tazobactam** is recommended. For patients without MRE risk factors, broad-spectrum **Cephalosporins** are often used.
