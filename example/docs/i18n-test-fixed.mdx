# Localization (i18n) Test Page - Fixed

This page displays the same resistogram for *E. coli* with two different locales to test the internationalization feature, using the full name for the organism to bypass the ID resolution issue.

## English Version (`locale="en"`)

%%RESIST org="E. coli" abx=PEN,AMP locale=en%%

## German Version (`locale="de"`)

%%RESIST org="E. coli" abx=PEN,AMP locale=de%%
