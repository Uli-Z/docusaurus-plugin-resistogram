# Test Case: No Data Found

This page demonstrates how the component behaves when the given parameters result in no matching resistance data.

## Scenario

We are requesting data for the organism *Streptococcus agalactiae*, which is also known by the synonym "Group B Streptococcus".

While this organism and the antibiotic class "Penicillins" are valid, there is no corresponding resistance data for this specific combination within the selected `de-ars-2023` data source.

The component should not crash or show an error. Instead, it should display a user-friendly message indicating that no data could be found for the specified selection.

```mdx
%%RESIST org="Group B Streptococcus" abx=Penicillins source=de-ars-2023%%
```

%%RESIST org="Group B Streptococcus" abx=Penicillins source=de-ars-2023%%
