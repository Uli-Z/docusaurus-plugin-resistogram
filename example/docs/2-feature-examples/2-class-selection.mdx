# Demo: Class and ID Selection

This page demonstrates selecting entire classes of organisms or antibiotics, as well as combining multiple manual IDs.

### Multiple Organisms vs. an Antibiotic Class

Here we display data for two specific organisms, *S. aureus* and *S. epidermidis*, against the entire "Penicillins" class.

```mdx
%%RESIST org="S. aureus","S. epidermidis" abx=Penicillins%%
```

%%RESIST org="S. aureus","S. epidermidis" abx=Penicillins%%

---

### Gram-Positive Bacteria vs. All Antibiotics

```mdx
%%RESIST org="gram-positive bacteria" abx=all%%
```

%%RESIST org="gram-positive bacteria" abx=all%%

### All Organisms vs. Cephalosporins

```mdx
%%RESIST org=all abx=Cephalosporins%%
```

%%RESIST org=all abx=Cephalosporins%%
